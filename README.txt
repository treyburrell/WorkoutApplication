A list of how your app addresses each of the requirements (iOS / Backend):
iOS:
Used AutoLayouts with the home page in structuring the collection views as well as with structuring 
the collection views in the list of exercises.
Used Collection Views with the home page and Exercise page as well as a tableview with the listing of muscles.
Used Navigation Controllers for moving from the home page to the muscle page to the 
exercise page and lastly to each individual exercise.
We integrated the API given to us by Backend, which they obtained from a workout website.

Backend:
Uses SQLAlchemy to model the exerises Has at least one GET, POST, and 
DELETE request that interfaces with the database.
